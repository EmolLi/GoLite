# GoLite

Go (often referred to as Golang) is a programming language created at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is a statically typed language in the tradition of C, with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.

GoLite is a subset of Go, that contains interesting features including variable, function, type declaration, control structures like if-else statement, switch statement and a bunch of other basic Go features.

The purpose of this project is to build a compiler for GoLite with target language of server side JavaScript (Node.js), to gain better understanding of modern compiler development via hands-on experience.
